# Music Object Detection with TensorFlow

This repository is a fork of the official [TensorFlow Models repository](https://github.com/tensorflow/models) and demonstrats how to build a fully-trainable Music Object Detector. 

The [MusicObjectDetector](MusicObjectDetector) folder contains the entire source code and detailed description on how to train and run such a detector on the [MUSCIMA++ dataset](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/muscima).
